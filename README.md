Here is a project I made using html and css. I originally made it on codepen under FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design curriculum. 
In this project I used information from <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/git-version-control-system-666a1ffd85d3">Towards Data Science</a> to create a git documentation doc.
